Micro Challenge 3   
By Flora, Manuja and Dhrishya   

Creating a Soil Button and triggering a visual by completing the circuit through the body.

The Idea - 
The deliverable requirement for the last micro-challenge was to create an interactive digital or physcial visual that uses the body as an input.

We initially began the process with ideating on different ways to incorporate a soil button and making the body a part of it. We first thought of collecting different soil samples from around Barcelona, once stepped on a specific soil sample, a visual would be triggered that showed the location and the quality of soil. However, we realised we were not playing around with the concept of the body and making it as interactive as possible. After a lot of different discussions with faculty members and within each other, we finalised on the idea of using the body to complete the circuit, and through the electrical conductivity that passes within the body when stepped on soil barefoot, a speculative visual would be triggered.We also experimented with a DIY heart rate sensor to potentially add to the interactive process, however we were unable to link it to the narrative and tried to keep it as simple as possible. Below you can see the images of some experiments we did with different sensors to shortlist and finalise the idea eventually.

Final Idea - Once stepped barefoot on the soil button, the circuit is closed through the conductivity flow within the body. The closing of this circuit triggers a speculative visual that is then shown digitally on a screen.
